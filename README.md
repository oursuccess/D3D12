# notes and my answers for <Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 12>

## notes:
1. These solutions are tested on Visual Studio 2022 only.
2. You need to disable conformance mode, and change the solution's subsystem to Windows to make the solutions run.
3. Some answers for ch06 & ch07 have wrong header path of "QuizCommonHeader.h", feel free to fix them
4. Comments for the answers are written in Chinese, so you might meet corrupted characters in comment area. Hope I can take the time to fix them.
